# Auction-App _(Offical Name TBD)_

### TODOs
- Come up with a name for this application
  - Also update the repository name

<hr>

## Getting Started:
- Download the latest stable release of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Download the latest version of [Git] (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Download the latest version of [2.7.x Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download [Visual Studio Express 2013 For Windows Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44914) (Wired connection recommended). _Be sure to install the 2013 version, last I checked the latest version doesn't work properly with Node._
- Download [Intellij IDEA OR Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
  - You can easily get a student license which takes a few days - in the mean time use the 30 day free trial
